To display the birth certificates with the default setting of paths / wiki in config.yml
you must add a symbolic link 'wiki' to the root of directory containing wiki data, a clone of https://github.com/tig12/ogdb-wiki
This permits to access acts via /static/wiki

This is useless if the setting in config.yml is an absolute url.

/static/wiki is ignored by git.
