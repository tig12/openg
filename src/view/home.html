    The initial version of the database contains the data used to perform <a href="https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5/historical-tests.html">statistical tests on astrology</a>, between 1955 and 1996 (see <a href="/history">historical data</a>).
    <br>These data were gathered by <b>Michel and Françoise Gauquelin</b>, <b>Arno Müller</b>, <b>Suitbert Ertel</b> and 3 groups of skeptics: <b>Comité Para</b> - Belgium 1976, <b>CSICOP</b> - U.S. 1979, <b>CFEPP</b> - France 1996.
</div>

<div class="margin-top">
    The program used to build the initial database is called <b>gauquelin5</b> (aka <b>g5</b>). See <a href="/about">page "About"</a> for more details.

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
The purpose is to permit the reproduction of statistical tests on astrology with more complete and reliable data.
<br>With the availability of birth certificates online, this is possible</b>. Checking thousands of birth dates is a big task, but it's really easier than at Gauquelin epoch.
<div class="margin-top05">
    Main steps of this project are described in the <a href="https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5">home page of g5 documentation</a>:
</div>
<ol class="simple margin-bottom margin-top0">
    <li>Gather the <a href="https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5/historical-tests.html">historical data</a>, check them, correct them, and merge them in a single database.</li>
    <li>Connect the historical data to standard datasets like wikidata and complete birth times to build larger groups.</li>
    <li>Build new eminence indicators and sort famous persons by eminence rank.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="open-data">Open data</h2>
Open data is a necessity to produce data usable for science.
<br>Scientific works need to be <b>verifiable</b> and <b>reproductible</b>. Users should have the possibility to download the data on their machines, and do what they want with them.
<br>So data contained in this site are released under a Creative Commons license. See <a href="/about">page About</a> for details.

<div class="bold">Free software (open source)</div>
    Open data could be generated by proprietary (closed) software, because the important thing is data.
<br>But the choice of opengauquelin.org is to use only free software, which permits easier verification and debug.


<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2>Wiki</h2>

The construction of a reliable database, verified by humans is a collective work.
<br>Anyone can contribute through a <a href="/wiki">wiki</a>.
<ul class="margin-top0">
    <li><b>Check</b> data present in the database</li>
    <li><b>Complete</b> the historical groups with new data</li>
</ul>
See <a href="/wiki">page wiki</a> if you want to contribute.

<!-- 
The data contained in OGDB integrate many corrections, so data are more reliable than the sources it uses.
<br><b>But one must be aware that OGDB cannot be considered as reliable.</b> It probably still contains many errors and the only way to be sure of the data is to check each birth date one by one, comparing the values stored in the database with the values written in the civil registries.

<h2>Towards reliability</h2>
Data containing birth times

<h3 id="trust-level">Trust level</h3>
Trust level is an indicator to measure data reliability.
<br>It defines 4 levels of reliability based on original documents.
<br>A trust level is granted to a data if the original document is available and verifiable by anyone.

<ul class="spaced margin-top">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">1 - Hospital Certificate (HC)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">2 - Birth Certificate (BC)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">3 - Birth Record (BR)</div>
        (= copy of the BC by an officer)
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">4 - To Check</div>
        Data possibly containing errors: data coming from Gauquelin, Müller, skeptic groups, wikipedia and other web pages.
        <br>Need to be matched against a BC.
    </li>
</ul>

Most births that occured in the 19th and early 20th century do not have Hospital Certificate.
<br>So the best we can hope for OGDB is to reach level 2.
<br>Currently, almost all data of OGDB are level 4.

<br><br><b>Remark</b> : Françoise and Michel Gauquelin, and Arno Müller were were apparently taking a lot of care to avoid errors. But in practice, <b>they didn't have access to Birth Certificates</b>: they were writing to the town halls ; an officer was copying the information contained in the BC and sending them back a letter. <b>They were only recieving Birth Records, level 3</b>.

<br><br>Gauquelin data are considered level 4 because of error sources:
<ul class="margin-top0">
    <li>The transcription from BC to BR.</li>
    <li>Gauquelin or Müller error when integrating the BR in their files.</li>
    <li>Error when original paper files where transcribed in an electronic form.</li>
    <li>Bugs in g5 program</li>
</ul>
