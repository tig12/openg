Didier Castille had access to the data of INSEE (French institute of statistics) and conducted studies with millions of dates. This led him to observe statistical anomalies.
<br>See links to his articles on <b><a href="http://cura.free.fr/articles.html#STAT">cura.free.fr</a></b>.
<br>Didier Castille agreed to make these data publicly available <b>but he wants to stress the following points:</b>
<ul class="margin-top0">
    <li>These files are not INSEE files, these are INSEE files adapted by D. Castille.</li>
    <li>These files are neither official nor scientifically valid because they depend on the good faith of D. Castille.</li>
</ul>

A new version of this study, &laquo; <i>Study of Mercury/Saturn aspects in top-ranked Chess and Go players’ birth skies</i> &raquo;, was conducted by Pierre Hérau in 2022.
<br>It shows an excess of Conjunction Mercury/Saturn compared with Opposition.
