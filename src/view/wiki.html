<h2>Send feedback</h2>
Any feedback is welcome:
<ul class="spaced">
    <li>About the documentation: are there any typos, things difficult to understand, missing topics?</li>
    <li>About the downloadable data: is current format ok for you, do you need specific output?</li>
    <li>Or about any other topic related to this project.</li>
</ul>


<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2>Check and correct data</h2>
One of the next planned developments is to add wiki functionality to the database, to permit a collective building of reliable and verifiable data.

<br><br>But this is not operational yet.
