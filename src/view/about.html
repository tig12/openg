<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2>Goals</h2>

The goal is to produce data usable for science. This implies several things:

<ul class="naked spaced">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Open data</div>
        Scientific works need to be <b>verifiable</b> and <b>reproductible</b>. Any user should have the possibility to download the data on his or her machine, and do what they want with them.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Free software (open source)</div>
        Open data could be generated by proprietary (closed) software, because the important thing is data. 
        <br>But the choice of opengauquelin.org was to use only free software. It makes verification and debug easier and produces better quality data.
    </li>
    
</ul>


<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2 id="data-reliability">Data reliability</h2>

The data contained in OGDB integrate many corrections, so data are more reliable than the sources it uses.
<br><b>But one must be aware that OGDB cannot be considered as reliable.</b> It probably still contains many errors and the only way to be sure of the data is to check each person one by one, comparing the values stored in the database with the values written in civil registries.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3>Trust level</h3>
To measure data reliability, an indicator was built and is used in this database.
<br>It defines 5 levels of reliability:

<ul class="spaced margin-top">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">1 - Hospital Certificate (HC)</div>
        Original document available and verifiable by anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">2 - Birth Certificate (BC)</div>
        Original document available and verifiable by anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">3 - Birth Record (BR)</div>
        (= copy of the BC by an officer - may contain mistakes)
        <br>Original document available and verifiable by anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">4 - to check</div>
        Data coming from sources à priori serious (Gauquelin, Müller) but in practice containing errors.
        <br>Need to be matched against BC.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">5 - the rest</div>
        Data without birth time or grabbed from the web (wikipedia, web sites).
    </li>
</ul>

Most births that occured in the 19th and early 20th century do not have a HC. So the best we can hope for OGDB is to reach level 2.

<br><br>Currently, almots all data of OGDB are level 4.

<br><br>Important remark : Françoise and Michel Gauquelin, and Arno Müller were apparently very serious and took a lot of care to avoid errors. <b>But in practice, they never had access to BCs</b>: they were writing to the town halls ; an officer was copying the information contained in the BC and sending them back a letter. They were only recieving BRs.

<br><br>So here is a first source of error, the transcription from BC to BR.
<br>Other sources of errors exist:
<ul class="margin-top spaced">
    <li>Gauquelin or Müller error when integrating the BR in their files.</li>
    <li>Error when original paper files where put in an electronic form.</li>
    <li>Bugs in g5 program should be added to this list...</li>
</ul>
