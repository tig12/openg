<h2>Goals</h2>

The goal is to produce data usable for science. This implies several things:

<ul class="naked spaced">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Open data</div>
        Scientific works need to be verifiable and reproductible. Any user should have the possibility to download the data on his or her machine, and do what they want with them.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Free software (open source)</div>
        Open data could be generated by proprietary (closed) software, but the choice of opengauquelin.org was to use only free software. It makes verification and debug easier and produces better quality data.

<h3>Ertel</h3>
One motivation which led to the development of ogd is the desire to reproduce the analysis of Suitbert Ertel exposed in the book "<b>The tenacious mars effect</b>". He gathered the data of the different tests done on sportsmen (Gauquelin and 3 skeptic groups) and he applied a measure of eminence based on citation count.
