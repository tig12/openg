<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

Goals of OGDB are described on <a href="https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5">home page of g5 documentation</a>:
<ol class="simple margin-bottom">
    <li>Gather the <a href="https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5/historical-tests.html">historical data</a>, check them, correct them, and merge them in a single database.</li>
    <li>Connect the historical data to standard datasets like wikidata and complete birth times to build larger groups.</li>
    <li>Build new eminence indicators and sort famous persons by eminence rank.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2 id="open-data">Need for open data</h2>
Open data is a necessity to produce data usable for science.

<ul class="naked spaced">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Open data</div>
        Scientific works need to be <b>verifiable</b> and <b>reproductible</b>. Any user should have the possibility to download the data on his or her machine, and do what they want with them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Free software (open source)</div>
        Open data could be generated by proprietary (closed) software, because the important thing is data. 
        <br>But the choice of opengauquelin.org was to use only free software. It makes verification and debug easier and produces better quality data.
    </li>
</ul>

One of the purposes is to restore the groups of sportsmen, in order to have a reproduction of Ertel's work about the mars effect, described in book <b><i>The Tenacious Mars effect</i></b>.

<h2 id="what-is-good-data">What is good data ?</h2>
The definition of "good data" used in this program is :
<ol class="spaced margin-top">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Expressed in open and standard formats.</div>
        <ul class="spaced margin-top">
            <li>
                <b>Encoded in UTF-8</b>. The program does not handle other character encodings. Raw data encoded in other encodings still in use in some systems must be converted before being processed. All generated data use UTF-8.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use only open formats</b>. The program uses csv, txt, json and yaml.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Express dates in a standard format</b>. The program uses ISO 8601. This choice is not completely satisfactory because ISO 8601 is not fully available for free.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Express countries in a standard format</b>. The program uses ISO 3166 2-letter codes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Relate places to a standard</b>. The program uses <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">geonames.org</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use a standard list of occupation codes</b> among all data. A convenient standard list was not found. The program uses a home-made list of codes (which is not satisfactory, but at least operational and consistent among generated files).
                <br>Most of g5 are occupations are related to Wikidata, but Wikidata was not used because come codes are missing (eg "conductor of military band").
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Precise and identifiable without ambiguity.</div>
        <ul class="spaced margin-top">
            <li>Different forms of a person's name are sometimes needed :
                <ul>

                        <b>Exact</b> spelling of family and given names used in birth certificates.
                    </li>

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="bold margin-bottom">Connected to other data sets.</div>
        Persons should be related to at least one standard id. This is currently not done by the program, but preparatory code has been written to link the data to <a href="wikidata.html">wikidata.org</a>.

    <li>                      
        <div class="bold margin-bottom">Verified and verifiable.</div>
        An image or a link to the original document.
        <!-- 
        A complete correction of data would need an exhaustive check on civil registries ; the documents used as a primary source of information should be available to anyone for check.
        <br>This has not been done. Verification is now possible at least for persons born in France before world war I, because most french civil registries can be freely consulted online.

<h2 id="trust-level">Trust level</h2>
<!-- 
The data contained in OGDB integrate many corrections, so data are more reliable than the sources it uses.
<br><b>But one must be aware that OGDB cannot be considered as reliable.</b> It probably still contains many errors and the only way to be sure of the data is to check each birth date one by one, comparing the values stored in the database with the values written in the civil registries.
-->
Trust level is an indicator to measure data reliability.
<br>It defines 4 levels of reliability:

<ul class="spaced margin-top">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">1 - Hospital Certificate (HC)</div>
        Original document available and verifiable by anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">2 - Birth Certificate (BC)</div>
        Original document available and verifiable by anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">3 - Birth Record (BR)</div>
        (= copy of the BC by an officer)
        <br>Original document available and verifiable by anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">4 - To Check</div>
        Data possibly containing errors: Gauquelin, Müller, skeptic groups, wikipedia and other web pages.
        <br>Need to be matched against a BC.
    </li>
</ul>

Most births that occured in the 19th and early 20th century do not have a HC Hospital Certificate, level 1.
<br>So the best we can hope for OGDB is to reach level 2 Birth Certificate.
<br>Currently, almost all data of OGDB are level 4 To Check.

<br><br><b>Remark</b> : Françoise and Michel Gauquelin, and Arno Müller were apparently very serious and were taking a lot of care to avoid errors. <b>But in practice, they never had access to BCs</b>: they were writing to the town halls ; an officer was copying the information contained in the BC and sending them back a letter. They were only recieving BRs.

<br>This is a first source of error, the transcription from BC to BR.
<br>Other sources of errors exist:
<ul class="margin-top spaced">
    <li>Gauquelin or Müller error when integrating the BR in their files.</li>
    <li>Error when original paper files where put in an electronic form.</li>
    <li>Bugs in g5 program</li>
</ul>

<b>But today, birth certificates are available online</b>, so we can check and build reliable data. Checking thousands of birth date is a big task, but it's really easier than at Gauquelin epoch.
