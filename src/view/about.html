<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
The purpose is to permit the reproduction of statistical tests on astrology with more complete and reliable data.
<br>With the availability of birth certificates online, this is possible</b>. Checking thousands of birth dates is a big task, but it's really easier than at Gauquelin epoch.
<div class="margin-top05 margin-bottom05">
One goal is to reproduce the analysis of Suitbert Ertel described in the book "The mars effect".
</div>
Main steps are described in the <a href="https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5">home page of g5 documentation</a>:
<ol class="simple margin-bottom">
    <li>Gather the <a href="https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5/historical-tests.html">historical data</a>, check them, correct them, and merge them in a single database.</li>
    <li>Connect the historical data to standard datasets like wikidata and complete birth times to build larger groups.</li>
    <li>Build new eminence indicators and sort famous persons by eminence rank.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="open-data">Need for open data</h2>
Open data is a necessity to produce data usable for science.

<ul class="naked spaced">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Open data</div>
        Scientific works need to be <b>verifiable</b> and <b>reproductible</b>. Any user should have the possibility to download the data on his or her machine, and do what they want with them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Free software (open source)</div>
        Open data could be generated by proprietary (closed) software, because the important thing is data.
        <br>But the choice of opengauquelin.org is to use only free software, which permits easier verification and debug.

<h2 id="what-is-good-data">What is good data ?</h2>
The definition of "good data" used in this program is :
<ol class="spaced margin-top">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">Expressed in open and standard formats.</div>
        <ul class="spaced margin-top">
            <li>
                <div class="bold">Encoded in UTF-8</div>
                The program does not handle other character encodings. Raw data are converted to UTF-8, generated data are UTF-8.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="bold">Use only open formats</div>
                The program uses txt, csv, json and yaml.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="bold">Express dates in a standard format</div>
                The program uses ISO 8601 (<code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM</code>).
                <br>This choice is not completely satisfactory because ISO 8601 is not fully available for free.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="bold">Express countries in a standard format</div>
                The program uses ISO 3166 2-letter codes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="bold">Relate places to a standard</div>
                The program uses <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">geonames.org</a>.

            <li>
                <div class="bold">Use a standard list of occupation codes</div> among all data.
                A convenient standard list was not found. The program uses a home-made list of codes
                <br>Most of g5 are occupations are related to <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>, but Wikidata was not used as reference list because some codes are missing (eg "Conductor of military band").

<h2 id="trust-level">Trust level</h2>
<!-- 
The data contained in OGDB integrate many corrections, so data are more reliable than the sources it uses.
<br><b>But one must be aware that OGDB cannot be considered as reliable.</b> It probably still contains many errors and the only way to be sure of the data is to check each birth date one by one, comparing the values stored in the database with the values written in the civil registries.
-->
Trust level is an indicator to measure data reliability.
<br>It defines 4 levels of reliability based on original documents.
<br>A trust level is granted to a data if the original document is available and verifiable by anyone.

<ul class="spaced margin-top">
    <li>
        <div class="bold">1 - Hospital Certificate (HC)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">2 - Birth Certificate (BC)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">3 - Birth Record (BR)</div>
        (= copy of the BC by an officer)
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="bold">4 - To Check</div>
        Data possibly containing errors: data coming from Gauquelin, Müller, skeptic groups, wikipedia and other web pages.
        <br>Need to be matched against a BC.
    </li>
</ul>

Most births that occured in the 19th and early 20th century do not have Hospital Certificate.
<br>So the best we can hope for OGDB is to reach level 2.
<br>Currently, almost all data of OGDB are level 4.

<br><br><b>Remark</b> : Françoise and Michel Gauquelin, and Arno Müller were were apparently taking a lot of care to avoid errors. But in practice, <b>they didn't have access to Birth Certificates</b>: they were writing to the town halls ; an officer was copying the information contained in the BC and sending them back a letter. <b>They were only recieving Birth Records, level 3</b>.

<br><br>Gauquelin data are considered level 4 because of error sources:
<ul class="margin-top spaced">
    <li>The transcription from BC to BR.</li>
    <li>Gauquelin or Müller error when integrating the BR in their files.</li>
    <li>Error when original paper files where transcribed in an electronic form.</li>
    <li>Bugs in g5 program</li>
</ul>
