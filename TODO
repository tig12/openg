Change in database (todos for gauquelin5 software)
- store lg, lat as doubles in json structure
- store nobiliary particle as string (not boolean)

- Encapsulate all GET requests to the api in a function:
Replace calls like:
	url = restURL + "/stats"
	response, err = http.Get(url)
by something like:
write API_get(url)
And in function API_get(), write clear error message saying that you need to start postgrest !!!
